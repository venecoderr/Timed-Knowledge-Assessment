# Timed Knowledge Assessment

## Description

This is a knowledge assessment webapp that is timed and keeps high scores. I wanted to test my knowledge about web APIs and so I use them to build a web API knowledge assestment website, now I have put to practice what I learn and have something to come back to and review in the future, I really practiced the tools I adquired last week.

## Usage

The main page will give you the option to start right away or review the scoreboard before taking the test  
There is a header with a 'Highscores' button on the left corner that will take you to the scoreboard

The test itself will look like this, the clocks starts running when you click start  
If your answer is correct you get 10 points and a 10 second bonus or if your answer is wrong you lose 10 seconds  
When the time runs out it's game over  
Your score will be hidden until the test is over  
You can still quit halfway and go to the scoreboard with the 'Highscore' button on the corner

After the test is over your final score will be revealed  
You have the option to add it to the scoreboard
